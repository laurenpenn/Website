== Frequently Asked Questions ==


 = Related Plugins =
 The following plugins may be used in conjunction with PowerPress.
 
 * [Eli's PowerPress Addon Widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podpress-addons/) - Adds a sidebar widget that lists your podcast episodes linked to the play in a new window PowerPress player.
 * [PowerPress Posts From MySQL](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/powerpress-posts-from-mysql/developers/) - Creates blog posts with PowerPress podcast episode information from a MySQL table.

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress support multiple enclosures in one feed item/post? =
Blubrry PowerPress does not allow you to include multiple media files for one feed item (blog post). This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures in feeds differently. iTunes will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistency combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21) and the [FeedValidator.org recommendation against it](http://www.feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/DuplicateEnclosure.html) is why the Blubrry PowerPress does not support them.

As a alternative, PowerPress allows you to create additional Custom Podcast Feeds to associate any magnitude of media format and/or length in a blog post to specific custom feeds. For example, you can create one blog post associated to separate video and audio podcast feeds saving you time from entering your show notes twice. 

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress include media statistics built-in? =
 Blubrry PowerPress does not include media statistics built-in. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that's a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would add bloat to an otherwise efficient WordPress podcasting plugin. We recommend using your media hosting's web statistics to give you basic download numbers and, if you are seeking more grandular measurements such as client and geographical information for each episode, you're more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](http://www.blubrry.com/podcast_statistics/) as well.
 
 You may however access your Blubrry Statistics from within your WordPress dashboard.
 
 = How do you insert the player within a blog post? =
You can insert the media player within yoru blog posts by using the WordPress shortcode feature. The shortcode for PowerPress is [powerpress] (all lowercase)

 You may use the shortcode to add a player to other media files (non episode files) by specifying the media url in the shortcode: [powerpress url="http://example.com/path/to/media.mp3"]
	
 For advanced users with multiple podcast feeds, you may insert the player for a specific feed by specifying the feed slug in the shortcode: [powerpress feed="podcast"]
 
 If you want to specify a cover image, add an image attribute which points to the specific image url: [powerpress image="http://example.com/path/to/cover_image.jpg"] *Experimental*
	
 = Why can't you upload large media files? =
 File uploads are tricky to handle because there are so many web hosting variations with different upload size limits. We recommend using an FTP application to upload large media files. FTP is much more efficient than web based uploads and is typically provided by nearly all web hosting providers.

 = Will you be upgrading the version of Flow Player to 3.x? =
 Because of the feature restrictions and branding that FlowPlayer.org places on FlowPlayer 3.x versions, we do not plan on updating the player packaged with PowerPress. The **PAID open-source** FlowPlayer is not compatible with the **FREE open source** PowerPress plugin.




== Installation ==
To install Blubrry PowerPress manually, follow these steps:
1. Copy the entire directory from the downloaded zip file into the /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Activate the "Blubrry PowerPress" plugin in the Plugin Management page.
3. Configure your Blubrry PowerPress by going to the **Settings** > **Blubrry PowerPress** page.
