The Podcasting plugin by TSG enhances WordPress' existing podcast support by adding multiple iTunes-compatible feeds, media players, and an easy to use interface.

== Description ==

The Podcasting plugin by TSG brings complete podcasting support to WordPress.

Podcasting also includes a player allowing visitors to your site to view the file on the web.

= Features =

- Adds a dedicated Podcasting feed with full iTunes support
- Includes the ability to have multiple podcasting feeds based on file format or other factors
- Includes both an audio and video player for in-post listening/watching
- Fully integrates with any existing enclosures already stored in WordPress
- Offers a migration tool for users of podPress

== Installation ==

You install this plugin just like any other WordPress plugin.
The basic way is to extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
