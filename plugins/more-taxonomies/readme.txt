Add more taxonomies, besides categories or tags, to your WordPress installation. Also allows you to edit built in taxonomies.

== Description ==

More Taxonomies is a plugin that adds new taxonomies to your WordPress installation, using an easy-to-use interface in the admin. For instance if you run a football site you could create a team taxonomy (non-hierarchical, like tags) and set teams on your posts relating to a specific game. If you run a music blog you could create taxonomies for artists, musicians or perhaps producers. In adding new taxonomies, you could be linking more specific information to your posts, enabling you access more relvant related posts and information.

If you use [More Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-types/) in addition to More Taxonomies you could for instance add a hierarchical (like categories) taxonomy to a specific post type for courses—like appetizer, entrée, relevés, main course, salad or dessert.

With More Taxonomies you can:

* Create additional taxonomies
* Set different editing capabilities for taxonomies based on user roles (rights to edit, review, save), even for built in taxonomies
* List taxonomy items in specific menus in the WordPress admin

More Taxonomies is part of a suite of plugins created to enhance the functionality of a vanilla WordPress installation. With [More Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-fields/) you can create additional input fields for easier management of Custom fields, with [More Types](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-types/) you can create additional post types besides Posts and Pages. More Taxonomies works without the other plugins but interacts with them nicely.

This plugins was born out of the development work done for [Dagensskiva](http://dagensskiva.com/), [Dagensbok](http://dagensbok.com/) and user requests.
